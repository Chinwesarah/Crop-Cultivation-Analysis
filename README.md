# Crop-Cultivation-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of agriculture, focusing on cultivation of rice, oats,spinach and molasses. The dataset provides information on the crops areas,
production, and yields across different countries and years. The goal is to utililize microsoft excel to create interactive visualizations to reveal trends, patterns, and disparities in agricultural practices so as to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions for sustainable farming and resource allocation.

## Data Sources
Please refer to the attached Microsoft excel document

## Tool(s)
-Microsoft Excel - Pivot tables, charts, dashboards and slicers

## Data Cleaning
To ensure data integrity and eliminate redundant and duplicate data, the following steps were taken:
1. The column names `Area` and `Item` where changed to `Country` and `Crop` respectively for better understanding.
2. `China` and `China, Mainland` were found to have very similar data, the percentage difference between their data values was less than 5%, so `China, Mainland` was removed as duplicate data.
3. `Year code` column was also removed as duplicate data

## Data Analysis and Visualization
1. Uncover worldwide crops production trends
2. Analyse crop metrics by identifying disparities and variations in the relationship between areas harvested, production and yield of crops across different countries and years. To achieve this, countries were ranked from highest to lowest for areas harvested, production and yield. Then the top 20 countries in each category were selected and analysed.
3. Identify top and bottom producing countries of oats
4. Conduct a Pareto analysis on the largest crop production - rice
